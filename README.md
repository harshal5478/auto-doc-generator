Auto Doc Generator is a Python tool that automates the creation of personalized Word (.docx) and PDF files from an Excel spreadsheet. By using a template with placeholders like {{ name }} and {{ content }}, it reads data from an Excel file, generates multiple documents, and converts them to PDFs, saving them in an organized output folder. The project includes a simple structure with a script (generate.py), sample Excel and template files, and a requirements file for necessary Python libraries. Itâ€™s ideal for creating certificates, letters, and reports quickly, and can be easily set up by installing dependencies and running the script. This open-source project is beginner-friendly and ready for customization.# auto-doc-generator
